## Covid Report
The COVID pandemic started in January of 2020. That was when the CDC reported that the first confirmed case in the United States was here, in the state of Washington. At the time, no one knew truly knew how serious COVID would go onto become. Almost three years later, there have been `r get_total_cases()` cases in the United States alone, as well `r get_total_deaths()` deaths from COVID. 


I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
